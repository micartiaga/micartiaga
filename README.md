## 🚀 About Me
I’m a **Data Engineer** with a background in frontend development and a strong focus on **cloud architecture**, **scalable solutions**, and **applied artificial intelligence**.  
While most of my professional work is proprietary and cannot be shared publicly, I’m actively **reactivating my GitHub** with open-source projects.  

Currently **training in Machine Learning & AI**, exploring **AI-driven data pipelines**, and enjoying the *coding vibe* — bringing ideas to life, one repo at a time. 🚀
